## My solution to the most popular challenge on /r/dailyprogrammer

I recently found the /r/dailyprogrammer subreddit, which has weekly programming challenges. The most popular challenge on the subreddit is called "Disemvoweler". Disemvoweling means removing the vowels from text. (For this challenge, the letters a, e, i, o, and u are considered vowels, and the letter y is not.) The idea is to make text difficult but not impossible to read, for when somebody posts something so idiotic you want people who are reading it to get extra frustrated.
